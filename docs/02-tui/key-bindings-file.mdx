# Key Binding File

## Overview

ATAC allows you to configure key bindings to tailor your workflow. Configurable key bindings enhance usability and ensure you can interact with the application in a way that suits your preferences.
You can set up your key bindings by specifying the path to your configuration file in the `ATAC_KEY_BINDINGS` environment variable.

You can preview the default key bindings [here](#default-key-bindings).

## Setting Up Key Bindings

To start configuring your key bindings, follow these steps:

1. **Create or copy your key binding file:**

    - ATAC includes two example configuration files located in the [`key_bindings_templates`](https://github.com/Julien-cpsn/ATAC/tree/main/key_bindings_templates) folder from ATAC's repository:
        - [`default_key_bindings.toml`](https://github.com/Julien-cpsn/ATAC/blob/main/key_bindings_templates/default_key_bindings.toml)
        - [`vim_key_bindings.toml`](https://github.com/Julien-cpsn/ATAC/blob/main/key_bindings_templates/vim_key_bindings.toml)
    - You can use these templates as a reference or starting point for your custom key bindings.

2. **Specify the path to your configuration file:**

    - Set the `ATAC_KEY_BINDINGS` environment variable to the path of your key binding configuration file. For example:
```bash
export ATAC_KEY_BINDINGS=/path/to/your_key_bindings.toml
 ```

3. **Edit the configuration file:**

    - Open your key binding configuration file in a text editor.
    - You can choose between two options for text area navigation and editing:
        - **Custom**: Define your own key bindings to suit your specific needs (Used on the default configuration).
        - **VimEmulation**: Implements most of the Vim key bindings, including various modes and commands.

## Example Configuration Files

### Default Key Bindings

The default key bindings configuration file (`default_key_bindings.toml`) provides a basic setup that you can modify to fit your requirements. This file includes standard key bindings that are intuitive and easy to use.

Here is the default key bindings configuration file:

<KeyBindings />

### Vim Key Bindings

The Vim key bindings configuration file (`vim_key_bindings.toml`) emulates the key bindings from Vim. This setup is ideal for users who are familiar with Vim and prefer its modal editing style.
Considering text areas such as request's body, Vim modes are almost fully implemented.

## Accessing Help

ATAC provides in-app help to assist you with key bindings:

- **Current Key Bindings Display**: The help section at the bottom right of the screen shows your current key bindings.
- **Help Popup**: Press `Ctrl-h` (with the default key bindings) to open a help popup that displays all the hidden shortcuts and actions available in ATAC.

## Contributing New Key Bindings

ATAC is an open-source project, and contributions are welcome! If you create a new key binding configuration file that you think would benefit other users, consider creating a pull request to add it to the project.
